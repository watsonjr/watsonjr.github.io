We are involved in a number of research projects spanning complex systems science, marine ecology, resource economics, and sustainability science. Below you will find an abbrieviated list of projects we are presently working on:

### Predicting Illegal Activities at Sea using Complex Systems Thinking
Funded by **NASA** we are developing new data analytic methods for predicting illegal activities (i.e. really bad stuff like narcotics and slave trafficking) based on anomalous cross-scale spatial behaviors. The project uses NASA nightlight and AIS data in conjunction with new mathematical methods based on collective behavior in complex systems. 

### Cross-scale Properties of Complex Adaptive Systems
Funded by **DARPA** we are developing new multi-scale data analytic methods, based on manifold learning, for characterizing and predicting large changes in various complex adaptive systems, randing from ecosystems, financial markets, housing markets, power-grids and systems exhibiting collective behavior (e.g. fish schools). 

### Managing the Complexity and Dynamics of Socio-environmental Systems

We are developing novel mathematical models and agent-based simulations, and analyzing novel socio-environmental datasets for socio-environmental systems. Some of the topics we are working on include changing spatial behaviors of fishermen, human community vulnerability and adaptive capacity in the face of natural hazards, the innovation and diffusion of conservation norms, and predicting human mobility as people respond to climate change. 

### Risk Management in Marine Social-Ecological Systems
We are interested in thinking outside the box in terms of what tools can be used for developing sustainable marine social-ecological systems. In particular we are designing new financial tools that incentivize best management practices by both fishers and aquaculturalists. These include new insurance policies and forwards/futures contracts, and the use of new distributed technologies like Blockchain.

### Global Marine Ecosystem Modeling
Working with Earth-System Modelers at the [Geophysical Fluids Dynamics  Lab](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/), specifically [Dr.Charles Stock](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/charles-stock-homepage), we develop and run global marine ecosystem models that resolve organisms bigger than zooplankton (not obvious, but this is rare). We use simple size-based / allometric relationships as the backbone of our ecosytem models. The goal is to use these global models to estimate how pelagic marine ecosystem might respond to future climate change and different fishing scenarios.

###  Marine Connectivity

We research marine population connectivity - most nearshore marine species spawn  tiny larvae, that drift primarily with ocean currents. Where they go, and end up growing into adults is of great importance to developing effective spatial marine management, like **marine protected areas**. We are working on this topic from the modeling side - using simulations of larval dispersal in realistic and idealized metapopulation/community models to indentify important subpopulations. This work is continuing in the Coral Triangle where we are using coral metacommunity models to understand the impact of climate change on coral reefs. We also work on connectivity at global scales. Here, we are quantifying the routes and timescales overwhich planktonic communities are connected. This work combines Lagrangian particle simulations and NOAA drifter data with network theory. Results highlight where in the global ocean heat-tolerant planktonic organisms originate, and where they go. This is vital to understanding how the planktonic biota of the global ocean will change in a warming world.
