We are involved in a number of research projects spanning marine ecology, resource  economics, sustainability science and complex adaptive systems science. Below you will find an       abbrieviated list of projects I am presently working on:

### Fish, Fishing and Human behavior

I am part of a National Science Foundation funded project - a Dynamics of Coupled Natural-Human      Systems grant - to look at how human behavior is shaped by the environment in which we work. We      include colleagues at Princeton University - [Prof. Simon Levin](http://www.princeton.edu/~slevin/   ) - and a number of students), the University of Hawaii at Manoa - [Dr. John Lynham](http://www2.    hawaii.edu/~lynham/Welcome.html) - and NOAA - [Dr. Jameal Samhouri](http://jamealsamhouri.weebly.com/). We are developing novel mathematical theory and agent-based simulations, and analyzing a novel    dataset on the spatial dynamics of U.S. westcoast fishers.
