My research uses tools from the social, ecological and economic sciences to understand the           functioning of Complex Adaptive Systems. These systems are all around us, including the global       financial system, the human immune system and ecosystems. I am interested in learning from all these systems, but with a focus on social-ecological systems. My aim is to improve our understanding how   humans can live sustainably and with dignity. My projects span specific systems, from Southern       California and the Baltic Sea, to whole regions like the U.S. west coast and the Arctic, to global   studies. I am committed to effective science communication, and through the Stockholm Resilience     Centre we actively pursue partnerships with government, NGO and community organizations to link my   science to those who make a difference on the ground.
