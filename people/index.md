## Masters Students
<img style="float: right" src="Helena_photo.png" width="20%" />
2019 -- **Helena Edelson**, MS student in the Environmental Sciences Graduate Program, Oregon State University.<br>
Helena is researching sustainable, scalable solutions for conservation of snow leopards and other endangered species, involving climate change, human-wildlife coexistence, poaching and illegal trade. She combines Complex Adaptive Systems, game theory, aerial robotics, drones and satellite imagery to form richer data sets, increase accuracy and understanding, and overcome resource limitations on the ground. Helena has given international conference talks and keynotes on technology and complex adaptive systems. She comes to the lab with years of expertise in engineering massive scalable data for AI, machine learning and real-time analytics, from her long career as a principal software engineer in Silicon Valley.
