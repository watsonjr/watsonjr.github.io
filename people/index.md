The following is a list of people I have __active__ projects with. See the links page for a list of my past collaborations.

__Simon Levin__<br>
Princeton University<br>
Together we are working on the NSF coupled natural-human systems project on human behavior<br>

__Jameal Samhouri__<br>
North West Fisheries Science Center<br>
National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)<br>
The NSF coupled natural-human systems project on human behavior<br>

__Erol Akcay__<br>
University of Pennsylvania<br>
We are working on use mechanism design theory to help improve fisheries management<br>

__John Lynham__<br>
University of Hawaii at Manoa<br>
Again, the NSF coupled natural-human systems project on human behavior<br>

__Charlie Stock__<br>
National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)<br>
Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, [link to website](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/charles-stock-homepage)<br>
We are developing Earth System Models to include descriptions of upper trophic marine species. This is a continuation of work I did as a Nereus Fellow

__Mark Sanctuary__<br>
The Beijer Institute for Ecological Economics<br>
Researcher, [link to website](http://www.kva.se/en/contact/Kontakt-sida/?personId=4092)<br>
Mark and I are developing novel ''evolutionary'' models to describe the distribution of firm sizes. This is part of the Persson program run at the Beijer Institute

__Juan Bonachela__<br>
Princeton University<br>
Post-doc, [link to website](http://www.ugr.es/~jabonachela/)<br>
We are working on realistic (yet simple) mathematical representations of predator feeding rates, and their resulting food-web dynamics

__Anne-Marie Eikeset__<br>
University of Oslo<br>
Post-doc, [link to website](http://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/people/researcher-postdoc/aeikeset/)<br>
We are working together on a large Nordic project - [GreenMar](http://www.mn.uio.no/cees/english/research/news/cees/green-growth-based-on-marine-resources%3A-ecological.html)

__Emma Fuller__<br>
Princeton University<br>
PhD student in the Levin Lab<br>
Emma and I are working on empirical data on the spatial dynamics of fishermen. Our goal is to infer levels of cooperation between vessels<br>

__Lisa McManus__<br>
Princeton University<br>
PhD student in the Levin Lab<br>
Lisa and I are working on metacommunity models for coral systems

__Andrew Tilman__<br>
Princeton University<br>
PhD student in the Levin Lab<br>
We are working on mathematical models that explore emergent cooperation in common pool resouce systems

__Susa Niiranen__<br>
Stockholm Resilience Centre<br>
Post-doc, [link to website](http://www.stockholmresilience.org/contact/staff/niiranen.5.7549e4d91267b3b988780002234.html)<br>
Susa and I are part of the GreenMar Nordic project. We are looking at how the Arctic social-ecological system will change in the coming decades

__Jean-Baptiste Jouffray__<br>
Stockholm Resilience Centre<br>
M.Sc in Ecology, [link to website](http://www.kva.se/en/contact/Kontakt-sida/?personId=4170)<br>
We're working together on modeling coral ecosystems

__Roweena Patel__<br>
Stockholm Resilience Centre<br>
Masters student in Social-Ecological Resilience for Sustainable Development
