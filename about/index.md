Our research uses tools from the social, ecological and economic sciences to understand the functioning of Complex Adaptive Systems. These systems are all around us, including the financial systems, the human immune system and ecosystems. We are interested in learning from all these systems, to improve our understanding and governance of **marine social-ecological systems**. Our projects span specific systems, from Southern California and the Baltic Sea, to whole regions like the U.S. west coast and the Arctic, to global studies. We are committed to translating basic science into solutions for the real-world, and we encourage partnerships with government and NGO organizations, as well as entrepreneurship based on our research.
