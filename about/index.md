Our research uses tools from ecology, economics, oceanography, computer science and applied math to characterize and understand the complexity and dynamics of socio-environmental systems. We take inspiration from complex adaptive systems more generally: These systems are all around us, including the financial systems, the human immune system and ecosystems. We are interested in learning from all these systems to improve our ability live sustainably. Our projects span specific systems, from Southern California and the Baltic Sea, to whole regions like the U.S. west coast and the Arctic, to global studies. We are committed to translating basic science into solutions for the real-world, and we encourage partnerships with government and NGO organizations, as well as entrepreneurship based on our research.
