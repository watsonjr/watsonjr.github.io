Our research uses tools from ecology, economics, oceanography, machine learning and applied math to characterize and understand the complexity and dynamics of socio-environmental systems. We take inspiration from complex adaptive systems generally: our interest extends to financial systems, systems of collective behavior, competitive socio-spatial systems (i.e. sports), and of course ecosystems. We are interested in learning from all these systems to improve our ability to live sustainably. We are interested in hyper-local scales, e.g. how people behave, as well as global scales, in particular how the earth system is changing. We are committed to translating basic science into solutions for the real-world, and we encourage partnerships with government and NGO organizations, as well as entrepreneurship based on our research.
