# Apply
My goal as a mentor is to help young scientists become skilled and self-sufficient, and to help them become leaders of sustainability science. I aim to give my students the freedom to be creative, but also the guidance required to avoid getting bogged down. If you work with  me, you can expect me and my colleagues to invest substantial time and energy into helping you achieve your goals. By the same token, you will be expected to bring your own passion, ideas and skills to the table. If this sounds good to you, please do get in touch.

If you are interested, please contact me before applying to Stockholm University, so that we can discuss your application. In your email, please include a description of your interests and how they fit with my work along with a CV.

### Masters students
The Stockholm Resilience Centre has an excellent 2-years masters program, dedicated to teaching core ideas from resilience thinking, and complex adaptive systems science. If this interests you, head [here](http://www.stockholmresilience.org/21/education/second-level-studies/social-ecological-resilience-for-sustainable-development-.html) for a link to the masters website. The second year of the masters program is dedicated to a research dissertation, and I would be happy to be a mentor for those who apply.

### Graduate students
I aim to accept one new Ph.D student every other year. If you are interested in doing a Ph.D with me as your supervisor at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, first go [here](http://www.stockholmresilience.org/21/education/resilience-research-school.html) for a link to the Ph.D    website. Then get in touch and we can discuss opportunities. The main goal in applying would be to secure funding. This usually comes from places like: [Formas](http://www.formas.se/en/), the [Swedish Research Council](http://www.vr.se/) and from [Europe](http://ec.europa.eu/     research/mariecurieactions/).

I have strong ties to the U.S., and those Ph.D students across the pond looking to expand their experience in academia can find travel opportunities at [NSF](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504876). I am more than happy to co-supervise / mentor students from   abroad.

### Postdoctoral researchers
I am actively looking for post-doctoral researchers to work with. At the Stockholm Resilience Centre, a post-doc is a highly independent researcher, so if in your research you see any benefit in working with me, get in touch. There are many avenues for possible funds
